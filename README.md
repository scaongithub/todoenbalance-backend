# TODOenBALANCE Backend Implementation Status

## Overview

This document outlines the current implementation status of the TODOenBALANCE backend system. 
The backend provides a complete API for the nutrition consultation platform with appointment bookings, payments, and administrative functionality.

## Completed Components

### Core Framework

- ✅ FastAPI application setup
- ✅ Database connectivity with SQLAlchemy
- ✅ Pydantic models for request/response validation
- ✅ SQLite database with migration support via Alembic
- ✅ Environment-based configuration
- ✅ CORS configuration for frontend integration

### Authentication

- ✅ JWT-based authentication system
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ User registration and login
- ✅ Social login integration (Google, Facebook)
- ✅ Admin authentication with higher security

### Database Models

- ✅ User model for clients
- ✅ Admin model for staff
- ✅ Appointment model for bookings
- ✅ TimeSlot model for available slots
- ✅ RecurringTimeSlot model for recurring availability
- ✅ BlockedTimeSlot model for unavailable periods
- ✅ Payment model for transaction tracking
- ✅ EmailLog model for communication history

### API Endpoints

- ✅ Auth endpoints (login, register, token refresh)
- ✅ User endpoints (profile management)
- ✅ Appointment endpoints (booking, management)
- ✅ TimeSlot endpoints (availability management)
- ✅ Payment endpoints (processing, confirmation)
- ✅ Webhook endpoints (payment notifications)
- ✅ Admin endpoints (dashboard, management)

### Business Logic

- ✅ Appointment service with booking logic
- ✅ Payment processing with Stripe and PayPal
- ✅ Email notifications using SendGrid
- ✅ Admin dashboard with statistics
- ✅ Recurring availability pattern generation

### Development Tools

- ✅ Database migrations with Alembic
